## what is Binary Tree ?

## what is Complete Binary Tree ?
- a tree in which all levels are fully filled, except for possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
## max heap: 
where every value of a node is greater than or equal to the values of its children
## min heap:
where every node has a value less than or equal to its children

Node = ith index
left child= (2*i)th index
right child= (2*i)+1th index
parent =(i/2)th index
